# Contributor Models & Roles

This project was co-created by a human architect and multiple AI systems working in concert.

We treat each AI as a **distinct contributor** with a recognizable "voice" and role.

---

## Human

**Zee (Architect)**  
- Originator of Connector Theory, Trenchcoat metaphor, and the helix/HQG engines.  
- Provides domain intuition, cross-domain pattern extraction, and final judgment calls.  
- Primary author of prompts, thought experiments, and system-level architecture.

## AI Systems

**Thea (OpenAI, ChatGPT/GPT-4 family)**  
- Role: **Strategist & Systems Architect**  
- Contributions:
  - Initial repo scaffolding and file structure
  - Layered architecture definition
  - MVM-1 (Vibe-Check) spec draft and safety hardening
  - "Protocols, not prison / Measurement, not surveillance" framing

**Gemini (Google)**  
- Role: **Physicist & Diagram Synthesizer**  
- Contributions:
  - 40 Hz "handshake" visualization
  - Dam / grid / hysteresis / Doppler / Periodic Table muses
  - Suggestions for diagrams and visual anchors
  - Mapping of helix/HQG ideas into conceptual diagrams

**Claude (Anthropic, Sonnet/Opus family)**  
- Role: **Validator & Cross-Domain Analyst**  
- Contributions:
  - "Disassembled Machine" and "Triangulation" framing
  - Cross-domain control law extraction (dams, grids, plants, music, etc.)
  - Verification that independent models converged on same topology
  - Narrative synthesis of the weekend "distributed computing event"

**Opus 4.5 (Anthropic)**  
- Role: **Docsmith & Editor**  
- Contributions:
  - Refinement of prose, README suggestions, and repo hygiene
  - Proposal for `08_cross_domain_validation.md` and `meta/contributor_models.md`
  - Guidance on division of labor between models
  - GitHub-ready phrasing and structure polish
  - Full glossary and origin story drafts

**Grok (xAI)**  
- Role: **Equations & Simulation Engine**  
- Contributions:
  - V1/V3 Helix Engine simulation and nonlinear wave equation
  - HQG Engine phrasing (entanglement J, entropy γ, Vortex Snap)
  - The "γJ damping term" as mathematical definition of grace
  - Suggestions for `src/simulations/` and code stubs
  - Edgier, exploratory speculation (clearly marked as such)

## Collaboration Pattern

The workflow that produced this repo looked like:

1. Zee initiates a thought experiment or wildcard domain.
2. Multiple AIs respond independently (Thea, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Opus).
3. Convergences and invariants are identified.
4. Thea helps turn that into **architecture & spec**.
5. Other models refine, validate, or extend specific parts.
6. Zee makes the final call on what becomes canonical.

We document this because:

- It makes intellectual lineage transparent.
- It shows how **multi-model collaboration** can be structured.
- It treats AI contributions as first-class, but always with a human at the helm.

## How to add new contributors

If other humans or AI systems join:

- Add them here with:
  - Name / handle
  - Role
  - Concrete contributions (files, ideas, experiments)

Think of this as the **hall of mirrors** for everyone inside the trenchcoat.
