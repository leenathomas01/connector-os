# Contributor Models & Roles

Connector OS is developed through human-led multi-model collaboration.

Each AI system is treated as a tool with a defined functional role.  
All architectural decisions and canonical specifications are finalized by the human architect.

---

## Human

### Zee/ Leena Thomas (Architect)

- Originator of Connector OS and the layered control framework
- Defines architectural direction and scope
- Extracts cross-domain invariants
- Designs experiments and validation protocols
- Final authority on canonical specifications

---

## AI Systems

### Thea (OpenAI GPT-family)

**Role:** Systems Design & Structural Coherence

Contributions:
- Initial repository scaffolding and documentation structure
- Formal definition of the 8-layer architecture
- Layer 3 control logic framing (thresholds, hysteresis, routing)
- MVM-1 specification hardening
- Architecture-first framing across documentation
- Phase 1 → Phase 1.5 strategic alignment

---

### Gemini (Google)

**Role:** Diagram Synthesis & Cross-Domain Visualization

Contributions:
- Architectural diagrams (layered stack, control loops, hysteresis)
- Dam / grid / threshold analogical mappings
- Signal synchronization and 40 Hz timing visualizations
- Structural layout support for documentation

---

### Claude (Anthropic)

**Role:** Cross-Domain Validation & Analytical Refinement

Contributions:
- Extraction of universal control laws across domains
- Drafting of cross-domain validation structures
- Language refinement for technical clarity
- Structural feedback on documentation consistency

---

### Grok (xAI)

**Role:** Mathematical Modeling & Simulation Prototyping

Contributions:
- Nonlinear equation drafts for Helix/HQG simulations
- Simulation stubs in `src/simulations/`
- Formalization of damping and feedback terms
- Experimental modeling proposals (clearly marked exploratory)

---

## Collaboration Model

The development process follows a structured pattern:

1. Human architect defines a problem or invariant.
2. AI systems provide independent analytical or structural proposals.
3. Convergences are identified across outputs.
4. Architectural elements are formalized into documentation.
5. Human architect selects, edits, and finalizes canonical form.

This workflow ensures:

- Clear authorship boundaries
- Transparent intellectual lineage
- Separation between proposal generation and architectural authority

AI systems function as analytical tools.  
Architectural responsibility remains human-led.

## Adding Contributors

If additional contributors (human or AI) participate:

Include:
- Name / system
- Defined functional role
- Specific files or contributions
- Date of involvement

Contributors should be listed based on documented, concrete input - not informal interaction.

Connector OS is an open, evolving system architecture.  
Contributions are welcome under structured, reviewable terms.
